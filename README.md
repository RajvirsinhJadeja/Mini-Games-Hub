# Mini-Games-Hub

A collection of fun and interactive mini-games built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Includes classic games like Sudoku, with more to come!

## ✨ Overview

**Mini-Games Hub** is a browser-based game portal, currently featuring an interactive, API-driven **Sudoku game** as its flagship module.  
The goal of this project is not just entertainment, but also to serve as a front-end development showcase that combines:

- Component-based UI logic
- Responsive design
- Test-driven development using **Jest**
- Accessibility and semantic HTML
- Clean code architecture & modularity

## 🎯 Current Focus: Sudoku

Sudoku has been implemented with a full game loop, API-powered puzzles, win/lose detection, and user feedback via modals.  
All core logic is modular and test-covered.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎲 **Sudoku Game** with interactive board and logic validation
- 🧠 **Game Win / Fail** states with smooth UI transitions
- 🌐 **Board generation via external API**
- 📱 **Fully responsive design** using `flexbox`, `grid`, and `clamp()` — no breakpoints
- 🧪 **Test-driven development** with **Jest**
